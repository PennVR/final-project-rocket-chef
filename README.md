### What is our game?

Rocket Chef is the exciting new sequel to [Attack of the Drones](https://github.com/PennVR/unreal-project-materials-and-textures) in the Materials and Textures family of games.

In a futuristic world, the Earth has run out of precious metals to sustain life. In an effort to continue the species, the space agencies of the world teamed up to create a program Metal Extraction Robot Team (M. E. R. T.) These robots travel to the moon, drill under the surface and extract the metal before traveling back to Earth. 

Unfortunately, they only have fuel capacity to take them half way to the moon (trade-off between size and capacity). Thus there must be a refuel station in the middle of space to make sure that the robots can complete the mission. If a robot runs out of fuel, it is designed to explode so that there is no large debris floating around in space.

The fueling stations have thus been designed to be as efficient as possible to make sure that no robot explodes inside. It is your first day on the job and you have to hit the ground running or end up being responsible for the destruction of an entire fueling station.

Rocket Chef is a fast-paced, immersive VR experience with a simple goal - quickly and accurately fulfill robot customer's orders in space. Use rocket boots to fly between customer locations and the kitchen. Complete as many orders as possible in the time allotted or risk angering your fickle robot customers. In order to help you create the different orders, multiple tools are provided, with different motion control actions associated with them.

### VR Mode

Virtual Reality sickness was one of the main challenges that we had to deal with when building our game. Virtual reality sickness occurs when a user's perception of motion (from the game) does not line up with what their body is feeling through the vestibular system and other propioreceptors. 

Our game is particularly prone to this challenge because we use the rocket boots to fly around space which means the user sees the motion everytime they want to move. Most other VR games use a teleporation scheme to prevent the user from feeling any sense of acceleration/deceleration. 

To get around this, we theorized that having the player wear a space helemet would create a fixed point of reference which would prevent the motion sickness. We have tested this with all members of our team as well as other players. Only one individual (who has a history of motion sickness) felt that our game was too hard to play. We have since made some more modifications and we believe we have reduced that as well.


### Hardest Part of the Assignment

There were four specific challenges that stood out to us.

* We struggled with making our game intutive to other players. We thought that the side grip button would be best for grasping objects, but most people prefer to click the trigger over the grip. Further, making sure that players knew where to go at all times was a challenge. We do not think that we have fully accomplished this, but we hope that the game makes sense to some extent.

* We faced a lot of difficulty in working on different parts of the project at the same time. At first we took care of this by having different levels that various people worked on, but after integration, it significantly slowed productivity since the map could only be edited by one of our members at a time.

* We also spent a lot of time making our game immersive. At first we focused on making sure that the game we had was fun to play -- engaging and exciting. The next focus was on having an ambiance that was fun and playful. This included adding music and more lighting. Finally we used some pre-built assets to make the world come to life.

* We had many frame rate issues throughout the game. We offset a lot of this by reducing the number of particle effects, but the biggest breakthrough came by using forward shading instead of deferred shading.
